## About The Project

DJ4H is a Discord bot designed for the "4-hour Game" on the Async - Community server (formerly Graven - Développement).
Its primary purpose is to automate point counting.

Although designed for the Async - Community server, the bot can be used on other servers and can run on multiple servers
simultaneously.

DJ4H implements a competitive timing game called "The 4h Game". Players compete by sending messages in a designated
channel after a configurable delay period has passed since the last message.

## Features

- Automatic point counting
- Leaderboard image generation
- Player point management (set/view scores)

## Commands

Required command parameters are shown in brackets (`[required]`) while optional parameters are in parentheses (
`(optional)`).

### Configuration (Admin only)

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/config [channel] [delay]` | Sets the game channel and the required delay to score a point. Time prefixes: `s` (seconds), `m` (minutes), `h` (hours), `d` (days). |
| `/set [member] [score]` | Sets a member's score to the specified value. |
| `/dump_log` | Retrieves the bot's log file. |

### Player

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `/leaderboard` | Displays an image with the top 10 players. |
| `/score` | Shows your own score. |

## Database

The bot uses SQLite with three main tables:

- `guilds`: Server configuration (channel, delay).
- `users`: User scores per server.
- `messages`: Message tracking for game logic.
